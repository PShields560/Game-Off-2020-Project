Game Overview:
A level based top down shooter arcade game where every level is a self contained slice of gameplay that incorporates aspects of and builds upon lessons from previous levels. The game will consist of fighting hordes of simple enemies, dodging/destroying asteroids, solving puzzles, and fighting bosses. The game will have roughly 30 levels, and each level will have its own theme. Boss levels will always give the player a new weapon/drone/power after the first time completing the level. Other levels will have weapons/drones/powers as hidden or "not-so-hidden" collectibles inside of the game levels. Certain levels will be impossible to progress through without obtaining certain powers. The final boss level will be some sort of giant death star type of ship that satisfies the "moonshot" theme.

Story:
The player is the best space fighter pilot ever and the main enemy sucks and wants to claim that title for themselves. The player must complete every level and defeat the main enemy at every turn in order to prove once and for all that they are the undisputed greatest space fighter pilot ever.
