General Asset List

The overall style I'm trying to go for with this game is something like a glowing neon space shooter similar to the style of Geometry Wars.

All art assets will appear in the game with a glow effect added to them. Sprites with brightly colored solid outlines and semi transparent fill colors or just sprites that are a solid outline tend to work best with the effects applied.
